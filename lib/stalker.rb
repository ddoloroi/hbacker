# Modified from Stalker 0.8.0 
# Addes functionality to pass in the Beanstalk::Job instance to the Stalker.job Proc
# Allows the Stalker.job Proc to access the Beanstalk::Job instance at the runtime of the Stalker.job Proc
# The Stalker.job Proc can then get stats or touch the Beanstalk::Job instance (i.e. reset its timeout counter)
#
module Stalker
  extend self

  # R. Berger added beanstalk_style_job param
  # @param [String] job Name of the Stalker.job
  # @param [Hash] args The standard Stalker.job args
  # @option [Integer] :pri The Job priority
  # @option [Integer] :delay Delay in seconds before job is ready to be reserved
  # @option [Integer] :ttr Number of seconds before the job will timeout after it has been reserved
  # @param [Boolean] beanstalk_style If true, job will have access to the Beanstalk::Job instance as a 3rd arg to Stalker.job
  #   Defaults to false
  # @param [Hash] style_opts If beanstalk_style is true, then style_opts has members that control variations on the Stalker.job lifecyle
  # @option [Boolean] :run_job_outside_of_stalker_timeout The job will be run outside of the 
  #   Stalker Timeout Only the Beanstalk::Job#ttr applies. If you use this mode, there can be no
  #   before_handlers for this job.
  # @option [Boolean] :explicit_delete If true, It will be up to your job to explicitly deltete, bury or release the Beanstalk::Job instance
  #   Default to not set (false)
  # @option [Booleasn] :no_bury_for_error_handler If true, AND there is an error handler in place, 
  #   Stalker will NOT bury the Beanstalk::Job if there is an Exception while the job is running
  #   Default is not set (false)
